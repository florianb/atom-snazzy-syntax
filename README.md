# atom-snazzy-syntax theme

An elegant _not so bright_ snazzy-syntax-theme for Atom -- based on https://github.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy

![The not so bright snazzy-theme](https://github.com/florianb/atom-snazzy-syntax/blob/master/atom-snazzy-syntax-lowq.jpg?raw=true)

This theme aims for

- visually fitting into the [snazzy-terminal-themes](https://github.com/sindresorhus?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=snazzy&type=&language=)
- being less bright & therefore more relaxing
- showing invisibles & comments with enough contrast to be easy readable

## This theme is a living work in progress

Since i don't have any experience in creating themes for Atom i think i missed a lot of impovements. However - if you feel you'd like to change anything propose a PR or open an Issue. :heart:
